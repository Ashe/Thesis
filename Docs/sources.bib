% "The most prevalent techniques include finite state machines, scripting, agents and flocking. These techniques are well established, simple and have been successfully employed by game developers for a number of years" - p1
% "The use of fuzzy logic and fuzzy state machines as an alternative to finite state machines is starting to become widely accepted and commonplace" - p1
% "Finite state machines are used more frequently in computer games than any other AI technique. This is because they are simple to program, easy to understand and debug, and general enough to be used for any problem" - p2 (UNFOUND CITATION: "Implementing a state machine language")
% "The idea of an FSM is to divide a game object's behaviour into logical states so that the object has one state for each different type of behaviour it exhibits" - p2 (UNFOUND CITATION: "Desigining a general robust AI engine")
% "An FSM may not always provide the optimal solution, but it generally provides a simple solution that works. Furthermore, a game object that uses an FSM can use other techniques such as neural networks or fuzzy logic" - p2 (UNFOUND CITATION: "Desigining a general robust AI engine")
% "FSMs in games tend to include states within states, multiple state variables, randomness in state transitions and code executing every game tick" - p2 (UNFOUND CITATION: "Implementing a state machine language")
% "Game FSMs that are not well planned and structured can grow out-of-hand quickly and become very challenging to maintain." - p2
% "[FSMs can be used to] simulate the emotion of a non-player character" - p2 (UNFOUND CITATION "Game programming gems")
% "Important decisions that need to be made when designing an agent is the architecture and whether the agent is to be ractive, goal-directed or some combination of the two" - p2

% "AI is very dependent on concrete details of the game environment, which is the main reason why it's often added as one of the last subsystems" - p59
% "Customers value great AI" - p60
% "Market mechanisms will make it very difficult for AI to receive equal ranking with features such as graphics and physics" - p60
% "A game using probabilistic networks to predict the player's next move in order to precompute graphics may be on a high AI level" - p60
% "The goal in game AI is not to compute the most optimal behaviour for winning against the player. Instead, the outcome should be as believable and fun as possible" -p60
% "Given the highly limited computational resources, a sophisticated movement is a really hard thing to do!" - p61
% "The so-called A* algorithm is the most common basic ingredient for computing a long-distance route for an NPC" - p61
% "The waypoints with their connections span a net over the map, defining which regions / points can be directly reached from other regions / points. Given a starting point and a destination, the A* algorithm tries to find the shortest path along the waypoint connections." - p61
% "The algorithm uses an estimation component, which has to provide an estimate for the distance between a point and the destination point. Thereby, the algorithm can focus its expansion of a possible path on the most promising connections." - p61
% "FSMs (finate state machines) describe under which events/conditions a current state is to be replaced by another" - p61
% "The game has no general FSM interpreter, but the FSMs are realized by scripts and simple if-then statements" - p61
% "Decision trees conceptually are even slightly simpler than FSMs and represent branching structures that are often used to make high-level strategic decisions" - 62
% "The nodes in the tree are test conditions, which lead to different sub-trees. A final leaf node contains a resulting decision. Similar to FSMs, decision trees are conceptual tools and can be realized by simple if-then statements" - p62
% "Game AI spans a large array of tasks, and it is not easy to generalize the various approaches. They are most often highly tailored to the specific games and situations" - p62
% "AI approaches from academia, such as genetic algorithms or neural networks, are hardly ever used in game development. Such approaches are generally believed to require too many resources for development, tuning and testing. The general approaches must be heavily modified and specialized for a specific game to get anything acceptable" - p64

% https://arrow.dit.ie/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1063&context=itbj
% "Pathfinding strategies have the responsibility of finding a path from any coordinate in the game world to another" - p57
% "Conceptually, a graph G is composed of two sets, and can be written as G = (V,E) where: V- Vertices: A set of discrete points in n-space, but this usually corresponds to a 3D map and E- Edges : A set of connections between the vertices, which can be either directed or not" - p59/60
% "Pathfinding algorithms also generally need to know about the properties of these elements. For example, the length, travel-time or general cost of every edge needs to be known" - p60
% "It is of no use to develop complex systems for high-level decision making if an agent cannot find its way around a set of obstacles to implement that decision." - p60
% "A pathfinder will define a path through a virtual world to solve a given set of constraints" - p60
% "In most cases it is desirable to have agents that finds optimal pathways as following sub-optimal pathways may be perceived as a lack of intelligence by a human player" - p63
% "In addition to holding the map location each node has three other attirbutes. These are fitness, goal and heuristic commonly known as f, g and h respectively." -p64
% "g is the cost of getting from the start node to the current node i.e. the sum of all the values in the path between the start and the current node" - p64
% "h stands for heuristic which is an estimated cost from the current node to the goaln ode (usually the straight line distance from this node to the goal)" - p64
% "f is the sum of g and h and is the best estimate of the cost of the path going through the current node. In essence the lower the value of f the more efficient the path" - p64
% "The purpose of f, g,  and h  is to quantify how promising a path is up to the present node. Additionally A* maintains two lists, an Open and a Closed list. The Open list contains all the nodes in the map that have not been fully explored yet, whereas the Closed list consists of all the nodes that have been fully explored." -p64
% [The actual A* algorithm is laid out] - p65
% "A* requires a large amount of CPU resources, if there are many nodes to search through as isthe case  in large maps which are  becoming popular in the newer  games.  In sequentialprograms this may cause a slight delay in the game. This delay is compounded if A* is searching for paths for multiple AI agents and/or when the agent has to move from one side of the map to the other. This drain on CPU resources may cause the game to freeze until the optimal path is found" - p67/68
% "A key issue constraining the advancement of the games industry is its over reliance on A* forpathfinding." - p68

% "In the past, better computer graphics have been the major technological sales feature of games." - p44
% "Path-finding is an important problem for many applications, including transportation routing, robot planning, military simulations and computer games" - p44
% "Path-finding involves analyzing a map to find the “best” cost of traveling from one point to another. Best can be a multi-valued function and use such criteria as the shortest path, least-cost path, safest path, etc. For many computer games this is an expensive calculation, made more difficult by the limited percentage of cycles that are devoted to AI processing." -44
% "Typically, a grid is superimposed over a region, and a graph search is used to find the best path. Most game programs conduct path-finding on a (rectangular) tile grid. Each tile has a positive weight that is associated with the cost to travel into that tile" - p44
% "The path-finding algorithm usually used is A*" - p44
% "A few games use IDA* (Iterative Deepening A*), which avoids A*s memory overhead usually at the cost of a slower search." - p44
% "Real-time constraitns limit the resources - both time and space - that can be used for path-finding." - p45
% "The demands for realism in games will always result in more detailed domain terrains, resulting in a finer grid and a larger search space." - p45
% "A* is the classic artificial intelligence optimization search algorithm. It uses a best-first search strategy, exploring the most likely candidate while eliminating provably inferior solutions." - p46
% "Its effectiveness is based on having a good heuristicestimator, H, on the remaining distance from the current state to a goal state." - p46
% "Since IDA* iterates and repeatedly explores paths, this may result in a horribly inefficient search." - p46

% "Reducing the search space may significantly speed up A*." - p126
% "Finding the most appropriate data structure to represent the search space for the game world is absolutely critical to achieving realistic-looking movement and acceptable pathfinding performance." - p126
% "Hierarchical pathfinding is an extremely powerful technique that speeds up the pathfinding process. The complexity of the problem can be reduced by breaking up the world hierarchically." - p126
% "NavMesh is another popualr technique for AI pathfinding in 3D worlds. A NavMesh is a set of convex polygons that describe the 'walkable' surface of a 3D environment." - p126
% "The secret to the success of A* is that it extends Dijkstra's algorithm by introducing heuristic approach" - p126
% "A* algorithm improves the computational efficiency significantly by introducing a heuristic approach. Using a heuristic approach means, rather than an exhaustive expansion, only the states that look like better options are examined." - p127
% "A good heuristic function which can accurately estimate the cost may make the algorithm much quicker. On the other hand, using a heuristic that overestimates the true cost a little usually results in a faster search with a reasonable path." - p127 (UNFOUND CITATION, Game programming gems)
